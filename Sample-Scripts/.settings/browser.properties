# IEDriverServer WebDriver Capability Options
# 
# The following settings can be configured as required by project/application given the 
# best currently supported IEDriverServer WebDriver version and environmental factors.
################################################################################ 
# 
# IGNORE_ZOOM_SETTING: Capability that defines whether to ignore the browser
# zoom level or not. The default value is False.
# 
#IE_IGNORE_ZOOM_SETTING=TRUE
# 
# REQUIRE_WINDOW_FOCUS: Capability that determines whether to require the IE browser 
# window have focus before performing any user interaction operations (mouse or keyboard
# events).
# 
# This capability is false by default, but delivers much more accurate native event interactions.
# 
# NOTE: If zoom settings are ignored, enabling the REQUIRE_WINDOW_FOCUS setting may improve 
# behavior within IE. For example, REQUIRE_WINDOW_FOCUS might be set to True to ensure 
# clicks work when another window happens to be in front.
# 
#IE_REQUIRE_WINDOW_FOCUS=TRUE
# 
# NATIVE_EVENTS: Capability that defines to use whether to use native or
# JavaScript events during operations.
# 
# NOTE: If zoom settings are ignored, enabling the NATIVE_EVENTS setting may improve behavior 
# within IE. For example, NATIVE_EVENTS might be set to True to prevent a link that 
# normally opens in a new window from opening in the same window.
# 
#IE_NATIVE_EVENTS=TRUE
# 
# BROWSER_ATTACH_TIMEOUT: Capability that defines timeout in milliseconds for 
# attaching to a new browser window. The default is zero, which indicates waiting 
# indefinitely.
# 
# NOTE: A socket timeout of 0 is interpreted as an infinite timeout. Currently, the 
# socket timeout occurs approximately at the 3 hour mark.
# 
#IE_BROWSER_ATTACH_TIMEOUT=5000
# 
# INTRODUCE_FLAKINESS_BY_IGNORING_SECURITY_DOMAINS: Capability that defines whether 
# to ignore browser protected mode settings while starting the IEDriverServer.
# 
# It is noted using this setting can make testing unstable and harder to debug. 
# Selenium Devs do not endorse the use of this capability, and only provide it as a 
# best effort work-around for when IE Protected Mode settings cannot be set consistently 
# across all domains.
# 
# It should only be used as a last resort when environmental restrictions are in place 
# which prevent the proper setting of IE Protected Mode options.
# 
# NOTE: DO NOT CONFUSE WITH "ignoreProtectedModeSettings", which is an older, deprecated, 
# and now removed(in newer IEDriverServer versions) DesiredCapabilities option. 
# DesiredCapabilities are no longer supported as of v3.150.0.0 in anticipation for v4.0.
# See: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/cpp/iedriverserver/CHANGELOG
# 
#IE_INTRODUCE_FLAKINESS_BY_IGNORING_SECURITY_DOMAINS=TRUE
# 
# UNEXPECTED_ALERT_BEHAVIOUR: Generic capability (browser agnostic) that forces 
# Selenium to handle alert pop-ups in a explicit way versus dismissing by  
# default before throwing an UnhandledAlertException.
# 
# Possible values are "accept", "dismiss", "accept and notify", "dismiss and
# notify", and "ignore". The default behavior is "dismiss and notify".
# 
# NOTE: Setting this option to IGNORE may be required in applications where information 
# from an alert pop-up needs to be read, and either verified or stored before the 
# alert is accepted or dismissed.
# 
#IE_UNEXPECTED_ALERT_BEHAVIOUR=IGNORE
