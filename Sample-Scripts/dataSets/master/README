If your test data contains PII you may not want to store ANY of your test data in source control.

It can be hard to manage what files do and don't get put into source control.

Once a file goes into a Pull Request, it lives in the history in source control and special actions
requiring the assistance of the GitHub team will need to be taken to remove accidentally
committed / pushed.
